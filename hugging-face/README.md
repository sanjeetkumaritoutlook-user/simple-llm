## Hugging Face
Hugging Face is an excellent place to start learning AI, especially for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and transformers.

Hugging Face provides:

Pretrained models (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.)

A Python library called transformers

A hub to share and use ML models

Tools for inference, datasets, training, and fine-tuning

## 2. Requirements to Get Started
You should know some basic Python and machine learning concepts.

Tools you need installed:

pip install transformers datasets torch

pip install sentencepiece scikit-learn

pip install huggingface_hub[hf_xet]

pip install hf_xet

## 5. Explore the Model Hub
Visit https://huggingface.co/models

Search for a model (e.g., bert-base-uncased, distilbert, gpt2) and use it like this:

## 6. Fine-Tuning Your Own Model (Advanced)
Once you're comfortable, you can fine-tune a model using your dataset.

Use the datasets library:

## Hugging Face Course (Free)

https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/1

It covers:

Transformers from scratch

Tokenizers

Fine-tuning

Sharing models

## 8. Free GPU: Use Google Colab
To avoid local setup, use:

ðŸ“Ž https://colab.research.google.com

Sample notebook: Hugging Face + Transformers on Colab.

## 9. Next Steps After Basics
Learn about tokenizers

Try fine-tuning on custom data

Explore LLMs like LLaMA, Mistral, or Code LLMs

Dive into RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or agents

like a beginner notebook to start experimenting on Colab

## Embeddings and store it in Vector DB

embedding model like text-embedding-ada-002, bge-small-en, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, etc.

Or if they offer an embedding-specific endpoint like /embeddings or task=feature-extraction.

Better Way: Use Hugging Face Embedding Models Locally or via API

1. Install libraries

pip install sentence-transformers

2. Use a local model to get embeddings

3. Or use Hugging Face Inference API (hosted)

gets sentence embeddings from BERT?

Or switch to a sentence embedding model like sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 which is better for search/chatbots?

Get a sentence-level embedding

Use a lighter or better model for embeddings

Or visualize/compare embeddings between two texts

## PyTorch

What is torch?

torch is the main Python package of PyTorch,

which is a deep learning framework developed by Meta (Facebook). 

Itâ€™s widely used for building and training neural networks and doing tensor computations (like NumPy, but with GPU support).

## Inference = Making predictions
It means using a trained model to:

Answer questions

Generate text

Detect objects in images

Translate languages

etc.

## Hugging Face does not provide API keys for OpenAI models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4-turbo, etc.)
OpenAI models are owned and hosted by OpenAI, not Hugging Face.

You must get your OpenAI API key from ðŸ‘‰ https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Hugging Face does host some OpenAI-compatible UI demos, but those are rate-limited and not meant for production.

If you want to use Hugging Face for a free chatbot (Open Source only):

You can use models like mistral, llama-3, gemma, or phi-3

## Spaces

UI Demos (via Gradio Spaces)

Some Hugging Face Spaces use OpenAI models behind the scenes.

Example: Someone creates a chatbot app using gradio and connects it to OpenAI GPT-4 using their own API key.

You can try the demo, but youâ€™re limited by:

Usage caps

Disabled inputs

Rate limits

No access to underlying OpenAI key

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

## Github marketplace

GitHub Copilot Models Marketplace, a new initiative from GitHub (in partnership with Hugging Face and Microsoft) allowing developers to:

Use third-party AI models via GitHub Actions or GitHub-hosted environments

Integrate models like GPT-4.1, Claude, Mistral, etc., using GitHubâ€™s token-based metering system

Bypass the need to bring your own OpenAI API key (in some cases)

âœ… So, can you get a GPT-4.1 token from here?
Yes, but with conditions:

âœ… How it works:
You subscribe to the GPT-4.1 model on GitHub Marketplace

GitHub handles authentication and billing behind the scenes

You get a GitHub-provided token (not a raw OpenAI API key) that you use with the GitHub Models SDK or GitHub Actions

Github token Is not interchangeable with the OpenAI Python SDK (openai.ChatCompletion.create())
