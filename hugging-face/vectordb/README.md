## interface ui view in pinecone
give a metric: like cosine

give model dimensions like 1536

where to host (AWS, GCP)

using serverless for capacity mode

have api keys

insert data (upsert)

instead of using openAI embedding model.

Learn about vector search

convert these sentences into embeddings (vectors)

generate new id for embedding we have

in metadata , we store entire sentence

index.query is function from pinecone

## Python script that uses:

Pinecone as a vector database (for storing and querying embeddings)

OpenAI embedding model from Hugging Face (like text-embedding-ada-002 equivalents such as BAAI/bge-small-en or sentence-transformers models)

replacing OpenAI’s hosted embedding API with a locally or Hugging Face-inferred model, 

and using Pinecone for vector storage and retrieval.

pip install pinecone-client sentence-transformers

pip uninstall pinecone-client

pip install pinecone

pip install --upgrade pinecone


Models like BAAI/bge-small-en, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, or intfloat/e5-base are good replacements for text-embedding-ada-002.

Pinecone supports up to 1536 dimensions for many indexes; make sure your embedding model’s output matches this or create a custom index.

You don't need OpenAI SDK at all if you’re embedding via Hugging Face.

## perform similarity search using pinecone DB

##  Pinecone Console under your index to find region

spec=ServerlessSpec(cloud="gcp", region="starter")

## getting empty query results, it means either:

The vectors were not correctly inserted (or inserted into a different index),

The query vector format/dimension doesn't match the index, or

The query vector doesn't match closely enough to return top results (but that's rare for small examples).

## Try a dotproduct metric instead of cosine
Some embedding models (like bge-small-en) recommend using dot-product instead of cosine:

You’ll need to delete and recreate the index for this change:
