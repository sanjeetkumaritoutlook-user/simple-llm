save_to_db  cript demonstrates how to use a Hugging Face embedding model with Pinecone to store and query vector embeddings. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation:

## Imports

Loads necessary libraries: Pinecone for vector database, SentenceTransformer for embeddings.

## Load Embedding Model

Loads the BAAI/bge-small-en model from Hugging Face to convert text into vector embeddings.

## Setup Pinecone

Initializes Pinecone with an API key.

Checks if an index named demo-index exists; if not, creates it with the correct vector dimension (384) and cosine similarity metric.

## Connect to Index

Connects to the created Pinecone index.

## Embed and Upsert Data

Defines two example texts.

Converts texts to embeddings using the model.

Prepares vectors with IDs and metadata, then upserts (stores) them in Pinecone.

## Query with a New Sentence

Embeds a query sentence.

Searches Pinecone for the top 2 most similar vectors, including metadata.

Prints the results, showing similarity scores and the original text.

Purpose:

This code shows how to store text embeddings in Pinecone and retrieve similar texts using semantic search powered by Hugging Face embeddings.
