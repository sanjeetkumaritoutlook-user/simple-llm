## Best Practice:
Never name your scripts the same as built-in or installed libraries (numpy.py, pandas.py, json.py, etc.), to avoid shadowing them.

## Python libraries 
like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, which are core tools for data analysis and machine learning.

## NumPy (numpy)
Purpose: Efficient handling of arrays and numerical operations

Key Features:

N-dimensional arrays (ndarray)

Broadcasting, vectorization

Fast mathematical operations (e.g., mean, std, matrix multiplication)

Use it when: You want to do low-level numerical work or create the foundation for data processing.

## Pandas (pandas)
Purpose: Data manipulation and analysis

Key Features:

DataFrames and Series (like Excel tables in code)

Reading/writing CSV, Excel, JSON

Filtering, grouping, reshaping data

Use it when: You're cleaning data, transforming columns, analyzing datasets.

## Scikit-learn (sklearn)
Purpose: Machine Learning (ML)

Key Features:

Built-in algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

Preprocessing tools (scaling, encoding)

Model evaluation (cross-validation, accuracy, etc.)

Use it when: You want to build and evaluate ML models.

## Matplotlib
Plotting the regression result
