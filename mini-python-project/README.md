##mini project 
that uses all three libraries — NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn — to predict students' scores based on their study hours.

##Goal:
You have a dataset of students with hours studied and corresponding scores.

You’ll build a machine learning model using scikit-learn to predict scores based on hours studied.

## step by step
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

## Output:
Console will print:

Data preview

Mean Squared Error

Predicted score for a new input

A graph will open showing the regression line and data points.

NumPy  ->	Creating arrays (e.g., np.array([[6.5]]))

Pandas	->  Reading CSV, exploring data

Scikit-learn	-> Splitting data, training model, making predictions

Matplotlib ->	Plotting the regression result

##extended version 
with more features like study_hours, sleep_hours, internet_usage to predict performance?
